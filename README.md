# Popular PHP Repositories on GitHub

• This project provides a simple list of the top 1K PHP repositories hosted in Github. The repositories are ranked by the number of stargazers.

• This project connects to Github Search API & stores the max number of repos allowed for public clients (1k entries) in a local database. Data pull can be done via cli or UI.

• At this time Javascript is required for a full functional site, a warning message will display if the user has javascript turned off.

• Project is built using Symfony 3.4 

• Project uses Bootstrap CDNs for the presentation layer, so internet connection is required.

• WebPack was left out purposely, to reduce number of dependencies needd to be installed to run this project.

• Simple unit & functional tests have been included to this project. At the time of development I need deeper understanding of tests for private services. 

• I can also work out some Mink tests and add in the future.


From the list of requirements document

- [x] Use the GitHub API to retrieve the most starred public PHP projects.

- [x] This process should be able to be run repeatedly and update the table each time.
- [x] Using the data in the table created in step 1, create an interface that displays a list of the GitHub repositories and allows the user to click through to view details on each one. 
- [x] Be sure to include all of the fields in step 1 – displayed in either the list or detailed view.
- [x] Create a README file with a description of your architecture and notes on installation of your application.

## Tests

For testing, make sure phpunit.xml file is pointing to use a version higher than 6.
For that add the environment variable value to the php block.
Ex.

```
    <php>
        <ini name="error_reporting" value="-1" />
        <server name="KERNEL_CLASS" value="AppKernel" />
        <env name="SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_VERSION" value="6.5" />
    </php>
```

Also you will need to add the PhpUnitlistener block after filter block

```
    <listeners>
        <listener class="\DAMA\DoctrineTestBundle\PHPUnit\PHPUnitListener" />
    </listeners>
```


From your app root directory run

```
    vendor/bin/simple-phpunit --verbose
```
